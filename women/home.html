                      <p> a docor ,The importance of role models or mentors for women doctors cannot be underestimated. Both consultants and specialist registrars spoke of the advantage of having people in the department who shared the stresses of juggling work and family, not only other women consultants. An anaesthetist spoke of her department being “Run by people who have other lives. It's not just the surgeons and the anaesthetists, it's the theatre staff, ward staff. It's a whole department of people saying the operating session has to stop at half past five.”</p>

                      <p> a engeenir , many women discover in their internships that the engineering profession is not as open to being socially responsible or as dedicated to tackling pressing national and global problems as they had hoped. This is a result of the assignments they are given, the values that are supported, and the messages that are communicated to them. </p>

                      <p> a proffesor, Could traits typically attributed to females like accommodating, supporting, nurturing, and caring cause students to rate a female professor differently than a male? If females are viewed as more accommodating, might they be given a disproportionate amount of work? Scientific studies have shown these stereotypical traits cause females to be held to higher standards by students and given harsher evaluation ratings. These same studies found that female professors outperform males in service work yet are not acknowledged or rewarded. </p>

        <h2>Women Support Women</h2>
        <p>It is always gratifying to see women helping women; it is intensely so when the Consort of our Queen’s representative, the first lady of our land, gathers the helpful women of all nationalities, creeds and societies together, and by uniting them in one Council  enables them to work for the furtherance and uplifting, not only for womanhood, but all of humanity; inspiring them all with a greater love of home, a greater love of country, a greater desire to be helpful to others springing from the inspiration of the Fatherhood of God and the Golden Rule which this Council  takes as its motto.</p>
        <p> On the 8th of November 1894 Maria Grant enthusiastically introduced Lady Ishbel Maria Marjoribanks Aberdeen and her new National Canadian Council of Women to a large public meeting celebrating her and her husband’s, the Governor General of Canada, visit Victoria, BC.<p>  On stage beside her were a number of government officials and religious supporters as well as a large crowd of men and women, many of whom represented the various societies, associations, and unions which had worked together to organize this moment.</p>  <p>Both the Colonist and Standard featured the story on their front pages citing Grant’s call to ‘unite women of all nationalities, creeds and societies together’ as a perfect reflection of the Council of Women’s beliefs. </p> <p>  However it is not this phrase that historians or even contemporaries focused on for their understanding of the Council. </p> <p>The rest of Grant’s speech and Lady Aberdeen’s response to it, are traditionally mined for phrases such as ‘womanhood’, ‘unity’, ‘women helping woman’, women helping society’, morality’, and the’ Golden Rule’ and despite the apparent openness to women of all kinds in their speeches.</p></p>
