      Franklin is best known for her work on the X-ray diffraction images of DNA while at King's College London, particularly Photo 51
      taken by her student Raymond Gosling, which led to the discovery of the DNA double helix for which Francis Crick, James
      Watson, and Maurice Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1962.<br> Watson suggested that Franklin
      would have ideally been awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with Wilkins but, although there was not yet a rule against
      posthumous awards,the Nobel Committee generally did not make posthumous nominations.

  Sara Sabry to Become Egypt’s First Citizen Astronaut in Space

<span id="dots7">...</span>
<span id="more7">.<br>
  Non-profit organization Space for Humanity (S4H), has chosen Egyptian Engineer Sara Sabry, the country’s first analog astronaut, to join onboard New Shepard’s 22nd space flight (NS-22).<br>



  The announcement, which was released Friday, 22 July, marks an unprecedented moment in history as Sabry becomes the first Egyptian citizen to be destined for space and only the second sponsored Citizen Astronaut (CA-2) selected by the S4H after Mexican electrical engineer, Katya Echazarreta.<br>
  
  S4H’s Citizen Astronaut is the world’s first and only program which sponsors exceptional, purpose-driven “leaders” from diverse backgrounds and professions for an opportunity to gain a new perspective by going into space.<br>

  
  
  The New Shepard space flight is managed under Blue Origin, a private aerospace company owned by Amazon founder and American billionaire, Jeff Bezos.<br>
  
  
  The 29-year-old is a mechanical and biomedical engineer. Sabry is also the founder and executive director of Deep Space Initiative, a non-profit aiming to expand space research accessibility. On her mission, whose date remains to be announced, she will fly alongside five other crew members including Portuguese entrepreneur Mário Ferreira and British-American mountaineer Vanessa O’Brien.

    <span id="dots2">...</span>
    <span id="more2">.<br>
        She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire.<br>
        She studied at Warsaw's clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw.<br>
        In 1891, aged 24, she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees
        and conducted her subsequent scientific work.<br>
        In 1895 she married the French physicist Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics with him
        and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their pioneering work
        developing the theory of "radioactivity"—a term she coined.<br>
        In 1906 Pierre Curie died in a Paris street accident.<br>
        Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium,
        using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes.<br>
        Under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of
        neoplasms by the use of radioactive isotopes.<br>
        In 1920 she founded the Curie Institute in Paris, and in 1932 the Curie Institute in Warsaw;
        both remain major centres of medical research.<br>
        During World War I she developed mobile radiography units to provide X-ray services to field hospitals</span>

<span id="more3">.<br>
    The Egyptian Revolution of 1919 was a women-led protest advocating for Egyptian independence
    from Britain and the release of male nationalist leaders.<br>
    Members of the female Egyptian elite, such as Sha'arawi, led the masses of protestors while
    lower-class women and women from the countryside provided assistance to
    and participated in street protests alongside male activists.<br>
    Sha'arawi worked with her husband during the revolution while he stood as acting vice president for the Wafd;
    Pasha Sha'arawi kept her informed so she could take his place if he or other members of Wafd were arrested.<br>
    The Wafdist Women's Central Committee (WWCC), associated with Wafd,
    was founded on 12 January 1920, following the protests in 1919.<br>
    Many of the women who participated in the protests became members of the committee,
    electing Sha'arawi as its first president
    .<br> In 1938, Sha'arawi and the EFU sponsored the Eastern Women's Conference for the Defense
    of Palestine in Cairo, prioritizing nationalist issues over feminist concerns.<br>[16] In 1945 she received the Order of Virtues.

    Butler became aware of the slave trade of young women and children from England to mainland Europe in 1879. Young girls
    were considered "fair game", according to Mathers, as the law allowed them to become prostitutes at the age of 13.<br> After playing
    a minor role in starting an investigation into an accusation of trafficking, Butler became active in the campaign in May 1880,
    and wrote to The Shield that "the official houses of prostitution in Brussels are crowded with English minor girls", and that in one
    house "there are immured little children, English girls of from twelve to fifteen years of age ... stolen, kidnapped, betrayed,
    got from English country villages by every artifice

  A former flight instructor and test pilot, Collins was the first woman to pilot the Space Shuttle and the first to command a Space Shuttle mission.<br>

 A graduate of Corning Community College, where she earned an associate degree in mathematics in 1976, and Syracuse University, where she graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics and economics in 1978, Collins was commissioned as an officer in the USAF through Syracuse's Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps program.<br> She was one of four women chosen for Undergraduate Pilot Training at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma.<br> After earning her pilot wings, she stayed on at Vance for three years as a T-38 Talon instructor pilot before transitioning to the C-141 Starlifter at Travis Air Force Base, California.<br> During the American invasion of Grenada in October 1983, her aircraft flew troops of the 82nd Airborne Division from Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina to Grenada, and took thirty-six medical students back.<br> From 1986 to 1989, she was an assistant professor in mathematics and a T-41 instructor pilot at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado.<br> She earned a Master of Science degree in operations research from Stanford University in 1986, and a Master of Arts degree in space systems management from Webster University in 1989.<br> In 1989, Collins became the second woman pilot to attend the USAF Test Pilot School, and she graduated with class 89B.<br>
  
  In 1990, Collins was selected to be a pilot astronaut with NASA Astronaut Group 13.<br> She flew the Space Shuttle as pilot in 1995 aboard STS-63, which involved a space rendezvous between Space Shuttle Discovery and the Russian space station Mir.<br> In recognition of her achievement as the first female Space Shuttle pilot, she received the Harmon Trophy.She was also the pilot for STS-84 in 1997.<br> She became the first woman to command a US spacecraft with STS-93, launched in July 1999, which deployed the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, and in 2005 she commanded STS-114, NASA's "return to flight" mission after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, to test safety improvements and resupply the International Space Station (ISS).<br> During this mission she became the first astronaut to fly the orbiter through a complete 360-degree pitch maneuver. This was necessary so astronauts aboard the ISS could take photographs of the orbiter's belly, to ensure there was no threat from debris-related damage during re-entry.
